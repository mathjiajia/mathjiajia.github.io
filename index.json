I will use the following examples to explain how to use LuaSnip. s({ trig = 'mk', name = 'inline math', dscr = 'Insert inline Math Environment.' }, { t '\\\\(', i(1), t '\\\\)', }, { condition = context.in_text, show_condition = context.in_text, callbacks = { [-1] = { [events.leave] = appended_space_after_insert }, }, }) I set mk as the trigger for inline math environments. Also, this is an auto-sinppet, which means that you can just type mk and it will be replaced with \\(|\\) automatically. Note that | above is used to indicate the position of the cursor. After the mk is typed, you can type the math formulas you need and then press Ctrl + j to escape the inline math environment. Now the real magic is here. After escaping the inline math environment, you will see something like this: \\(formula\\)|, where | is the cursor as before. Then LusSnip with insert space when the next character after snippet is a letter. Note that for non-letter characters, LusSnip will not insert space. s({ trig = 'cite', name = 'cross refrence' }, { t '\\\\cite[', i(1), t ']{', i(2), t '}', }, { condition = context.in_text, show_condition = context.in_text, callbacks = { [2] = { [events.enter] = function() require('telescope').extensions.bibtex.bibtex( require('telescope.themes').get_dropdown { previewer = false } ) end, }, }, }) I use cite as the trigger for cross-references snippet. Because cross-references are not often used in the text, I set cite as a normal snippet: after typing cite, you need to press Ctrl + j to expand the snippet and get something like \\cite[|]{}. Then you can input some text in the square brackets, and then press Ctrl + j to jump to the curly braces. According to the settings, you will see a dropdown with the list of all the references in the document. This is a powerful feature, thanks to LuaSnip and telescope-bibtex.
